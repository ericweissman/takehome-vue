# takehome challenge - vue.js

### Background
This project was an exercise similar to a takehome challenge one might receive during an interview process. I was tasked with consuming the NASA Photo of the Day API and buidling a frontend using an unfamiliar technology: Vue.js

This app allows users to view NASA's daily photo and get more information about the photo. Users can view the previous photos of the month using a simple dropdown.
